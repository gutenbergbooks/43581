<a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a>
</h2>

<p>My original intention with regard to this work, was to
publish it in a series of three volumes; and to that end, the first
volume was presented to the public in 1906.</p>

<p>Since that time, however, I have deemed it advisable, for
various reasons, to incorporate all my data in one volume.</p>

<p>I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness for help in my
researches, to various works on Horticulture, and to many of my
personal friends who have given me valuable assistance.</p>

<p>I trust that this work will prove of some interest, as I believe
that it contains a fairly comprehensive list of both the indigenous
and naturalized Fruits of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

<p>This spreading evergreen tree is a native of Tropical America.
In the Hawaiian Islands, the first trees of its kind were said to
have been planted in Pauoa Valley, Oahu, by Don Marin. It attains
a height of from 10 to 40 feet, and is adverse to drought.
Its leaves are elliptico-oblong, from 4 to 7 inches in length. The
flowers are greenish-yellow and downy. The fruit, which ripens
from June until November, is a round or pear-shaped drupe,
covered with a thin, rather tough skin, which is either green or
purple in color. The flesh is yellow, firm and marrow-like, and
has a delicious nutty flavor. The seed-cavity is generally large,
containing one round or oblong seed, covered by a thin, brown,
parchment-like skin. The quality of the pear is judged, not only
by its flavor, but by the presence or absence of strings or fibre
in the meat, and also by the quantity of flesh as compared to the
size of the seed. Innumerable variations as to size, shape, and
quality have been produced from seedlings&mdash;some of which may
be seen in the accompanying illustration. The Avocado is easily
reproduced by budding and grafting, and the best varieties may
be obtained in this manner.</p>

GUATAMALA AVOCADO.
</h2>

<p>This variety is a native of Mexico, and although known as the
Guatamala Avocado, it is more commonly to be found in the
markets of the City of Mexico. Its leaves are purplish-green.
The flowers, which appear in May and June, are like those of the
preceding variety; and the drupe, which matures in the early
part of the year, has a long stem. This fruit is round, from
3 to 5 inches in diameter, has a thick, tough, rough rind, which
when ripe is a deep claret color, and the meat, which is a golden-yellow,
is tinged with purple next to the rind, and is free from
strings or fibres. There are but two trees of this variety bearing
fruit in Honolulu. They were propagated from seeds brought
here in 1890 by Admiral Beardsley. These two trees are growing
in private gardens.</p>

<i>Punica Granatum.</i><br />
POMEGRANATE.
</h2>

<p>The name was derived from the word punicus, of Carthage,
near which city it is said to have been discovered; hence malumpunicum,
Apple of Carthage, which was the early name of the Pomegranate. It is
a native of Northern Africa, and of Southwestern Asia, and is grown in
the Himalayas up to an
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: elevtaion">elevation</span>
of 6000 feet. It is a deciduous shrub,
which by careful training can be made to grow into a tree from 10 to 15
feet high. Many shoots spring from the base of the tree, and should be
cut away, as they draw the sap which should go to the fruit-bearing stems.
The branches are slender, twiggy, nearly cylindrical, and somewhat
thorny. The bark contains about 32 per cent. tannin, and
is used for dying the yellow Morocco leather. The peel of the
fruit serves also as a dye. There are several varieties of Pomegranate
growing in Hawaii: the double-flowering variety is popular
as an ornamental plant. All of the varieties are of easy culture,
and are readily propagated by means of cuttings of the ripe
wood. The leaves are lanceolate, glabrous, and a glossy-green
with red veins. The flowers are axillary, solitary or in small
clusters, and in color are a very showy rich orange-red. The
fruit is about the size of an ordinary orange, has a persistent
calyx, and is made up of many small compartments arranged in
two series, one above the other. The crisp, sweet, watery pink
pulp enveloping each seed is the edible portion of the Pomegranate.</p>

<p>The Fig is the most ancient, as well as one of the most valuable
of all fruit trees. Its name is nearly the same in all European
languages. The tree is supposed to be a native of Caria in Asia
Minor. The intelligent cultivators of Anatolia, by whom the
Smyrna Figs are produced, adhere to the caprification process,
used from time immemorial. In California, efforts have been
made to test this process. In the Hawaiian Islands, the Portuguese
seem to be the most
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: ssuccessful">successful</span>
cultivators of the Fig, and
several varieties are to be found throughout the group. This
common variety grows to a height of from 10 to 20 feet, is hardy,
and can easily be propagated from cuttings. Its leaves are alternate,
3 to 5 deeply lobed, and are shed during the fall months, at
which season careful pruning will increase the following year's
yield. The fruit is single, appearing from the axils of the leaves,
on the new wood. It is a hollow, pear-shaped receptacle, containing
many minute seeds, scattered throughout a soft, pinkish-white
pulp.</p>

Islands it confines itself almost entirely to the moist, shady valleys,
and thrives well, up to an elevation of 1800 feet. It is generally
gregarious, and on the north side of East Maui it forms a
forest belt. It attains a height of from 25 to 50 feet. Its dark,
shiny, glabrous leaves are opposite, elliptico-oblong, and from
6 to 7 inches long, and from 2&frac12; to 3 inches broad. The flowers
are crimson, fluffy balls, appearing in March and April, on the

<i>Averrhoa Carambola.</i>
</h2>

<p>This tree, which is said to have been named after Averrhoes,
an Arabian physician, is a native of Insular India, and is much
cultivated in India and China. It is evergreen, with dense foliage,
and grows to a height of from 15 to 20 feet. It is easily propagated
from seeds, and fruits in about three years. In Hawaii it
bears one crop annually, the flowers appearing in July and the
fruit in November and December. The leaves are alternate, odd-pinnate.
The flowers, which are borne in clusters on the naked stems and
branches, are minute, fragrant, and in color shading from a pale pink
to a deep purplish-red. The fruit, varying in size from a hen's egg
to an orange, is ovate, and has five acutely-angled longitudinal ribs.
The fragrant, light-yellow skin is very thin, and the pulp is watery;
it contains a number of flat, brown seeds. This fruit is of two
varieties: the sweet, which may be eaten raw, and the acid which is
delicious when preserved. A very appetizing pickle may be made from
the half-ripe fruit of the acid variety.</p>

SAPODILLA, OR NASEBERRY.
</h2>

<p>This tree, which grows on almost all of the Islands of the
Hawaiian group, is a fine evergreen, growing to a height of from
10 to 20 feet, and producing a fruit which is much prized in warm
countries. The bark possesses tonic properties, and from the
juice chewing-gum is made. Its foliage is dense, and the shiny
leaves are thick, lance-oblong, entire, and clustered at the ends
of the branches. The flowers, which are small, whitish, and perfect,
are borne on the rusty pubescent growths of the season. The
fruit, of which there are two varieties, the round and the oblong,
is about the size of a hen's egg. It has a rough skin, the color
of a russet apple, beneath which is a firm, somewhat stringy,
sweet pulp, having the flavor of an apricot. This pulp is divided
into 10 to 12 compartments, and contains from 4 to 6 large, flat,
smooth, black seeds.</p>

<p>This tree, which is a native of Mexico, is said to have been
named after Cardinal Casimiro Gomez. The first tree of its
kind in Hawaii was planted in 1884, at the Government Nursery,
Honolulu. The seed came from Santa Barbara, California, where
there grows today, a tree more than eighty years old, and which
still bears its fruit. It is a tall evergreen with irregular branches;
its digitate leaves are dark and glossy. The trunk is ashen-grey,
with warty excrescences. The fruit, which matures in April and
May, is large, 1 to 4 inches in diameter; it is depressed-globular
and somewhat ribbed, like a tomato; in color it is a light-green,
turning to a dull yellow when ripe, and it has a very thin skin.
The pulp is yellow, resembling that of an over-ripe, and
has a melting, peach-like flavor. It contains from 1 to 3 large,
oblong seeds, which are said to be deleterious.</p>

PEACH.

<p>The Peach-tree is said by some authorities to be indigenous to
Persia, while by others it is claimed to be a native of China. It
is a hardy tree, and has been known to bear fruit precociously
even in the second year after planting. If allowed to do so, the
Peach will grow to a height of about 15 feet; but it should be
pruned annually, in order to secure a good crop. Its leaves are
lanceolate and coarsely serrate. The flowers are solitary, pink in
color, and appear before the leaves. The fruit is soft and
pubescent at maturity. The stone is deeply pitted and very hard.
There are two well-marked varieties, the cling-stone and the
free-stone.</p>

<p>Ulupalakua and Makawao, Maui, once had the reputation of
growing finely-flavored seedling peaches; however, many of these
trees have been injured by cattle, and others have been destroyed
by root-fungus and insect pests. In several localities in Hawaii
good peaches have been grown from imported varieties.</p>

<i>Chrysophyllum Cainito</i> (purple variety).<br />
STAR APPLE.

<p>This tree is a native of the West Indies, and although not common
in Hawaii, there are good specimens to be found in many
gardens. It has large irregular spreading branches, grows to a
height of from 10 to 25 feet, and has rather thick foliage. Propagation
is ordinarily effected by seeds, which germinate readily,
when fresh. It can also be grown from cuttings of the ripe wood.
The tree derives its name from the words "chrysos," gold, and
"phyllon," a leaf; referring to the golden-russet color of the
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: under-side">underside</span>
of the beautiful, glossy green leaves. The small
flowers, which appear from June until October, are solitary at
the nodes or in fascicles. The fruit, which ripens in April, is
round, about 3 inches in diameter, has a smooth, tough rind, about
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: 1-16">1-16th</span>
inch thick, which is a deep purple in color. A cross-section
of the fruit shows the edible pulp with its numerous black seeds,
and the star-shaped core, from which the fruit derives its common
name of Star Apple. Unless the fruit is thoroughly ripe,
its milky juice is remarkably astringent.</p>

<i>Clausena Wampi.</i><br />
WAMPI.
</h2>

<p>This odorous tree is a native of China. It is a symmetrical
evergreen with dense foliage. The light, mossy-green leaves are
imparipinnate, the leaflets ovate-repand, and they are rough on
the under surface. The flowers, which are borne in clusters, on
the new wood, are small, yellow, and very fragrant. The fruit
ripens from June until October; it is about the size of a gooseberry;
the skin is yellowish-brown, shaded with green. The pulp
is sub-acid with a balsamic fragrance. It contains one large seed
about the size of a kernel of corn. There are two varieties, the
sweet and the sour; both may be eaten raw, and are very highly
prized by the Chinese. I know of but two trees of this kind in
the Hawaiian Islands; they are of the sour variety, and are growing
in private gardens in Honolulu.</p>

CAPE GOOSEBERRY&mdash;"POHA."
</h2>

<p>This shrub, or bush, is a native of Brazil, but is naturalized
in many warm countries. It stands partially erect, reaching a
height of from 1&frac12; to 3 feet. Its pointed leaves, heart-shaped at
the base, are very fuzzy. The open, bell-shaped flowers are yellow
in color. The fruit, which is about the size of a cherry, is
enclosed in a thin, yellow, paper-like husk, which is quite hairy.
When ripe, the fruit is yellow, and has a delicious sub-acid pulp,
filled with minute seeds. The Poha may be eaten raw, but is
much more acceptable when made into jam or jelly. The dried
fruit is said to be a substitute for yeast. In Hawaii, the Poha
thrives best in the cool elevations.</p>

<i>Carica Papaya.</i><br />
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: PAPAIA">PAPAYA</span>
(fruit, female tree).
</h2>

<p>The <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: Papaia">Papaya</span>
is a native of South America; it is found in Florida,
and in many parts of tropical America; it was early introduced
into Hawaii, grows and bears well in almost any locality.
It is a small tree, with a hollow, branchless trunk; it is short-lived,
and is suitable only to regions free from frost, and requires
perfect drainage. There are two forms, the tall and the dwarf, but
there are numerous variations as to shape and quality of the fruit.
The soft green leaves, often measuring two feet across, are variously
palmated, and have simple, long, hollow stems. The Papaya is usually
dioceous; the fruit-bearing tree is called the female; it is claimed
that trees of both sexes should be planted near each other, in order
to ensure a good yield. The female flowers, which appear from the axils
of the leaves, are yellowish-white, single, or two or three together.</p>

<p>The fruit of the Papaya ripens successively. It is either round
or oblong, and sometimes weighs eight pounds. The skin is thin,
and is bright yellow when ripe. The firm, yellow pulp has a delicious
flavor, and the milky juice contains a digestive principle
similar to pepsin. The seed cavity is large, and is filled with
many small seeds which are enveloped in a loose, mucous coat,
with a brittle, pitted testa. When fresh these seeds germinate
readily.</p>

<p>This familiar and highly ornamental tree, commonly known as
the Chinese orange, was very early introduced to these Islands.
It is well named Hazara (meaning thousand of fruit), as it is
one of the most prolific of the citrus family, and both green and
ripe fruit in great quantities may be found on the same tree at
almost any season of the year. The tree is of medium size, and
the small, shiny leaves have short petioles. It is
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: generaly">generally</span>

The flowers are white and fragrant. The round fruit is a
deep yellow, and its smooth skin is very loosely attached. The
pulp is also a deep yellow and contains many seeds, and the sour
juice is very plentiful. The tree is hardy and free from disease
and scale. Propagation is by seed.</p>

KUMQUAT.
</h2>

<p>The Kumquat is a native of Cochin-China, and is also cultivated
in Japan, Florida, and California. It is a low-growing bush
or shrub, having smooth, angular branches, and in both the round
and oval varieties the dark foliage is dense and beautiful. It is
a very prolific bearer. Its leaves are small, lanceolate, slightly
serrate, pointed or blunt and wedge-shaped at the base. The
small, white flowers come solitary or in clusters, the fruit varies
in size from a large gooseberry to that of a pigeon's egg, and is
either ovate, oblong, or spherical. It is 5 to 6 celled, has very
little pulp, and contains many seeds. The pulp is somewhat sour,
especially in the round varieties; and the smooth, thick, yellow
rind is aromatic and sweet; the Kumquat is generally preserved
whole, and those prepared by the Chinese are very delicious.</p>

<p>This ornamental citrus tree is not often seen in our gardens,
for it is subject to scale, and to the mealy bug, which destroy the
flowers and stunt the fruit. The Kumquat comes true to seed,
and may also be propagated by grafting and budding.</p>

<p>This small tree or bush thrives in Hawaii, and yields good
crops. It requires a sandy, rocky soil, and does well in the shaded
valleys. However, it is attacked by scale pests and root fungus,
and many valuable trees are destroyed in this way. The dark
green, shiny leaves are oval or elliptical, and emit an agreeable
odor when bruised. The fragrant flowers are small, white, with
an occasional tinge of pink. The fruit is small, varying in shape
from round to elliptical. The light yellow skin is oily and very
bitter, and the pulp is juicy and sour. The picture representing
this fruit shows several varieties, forms and shapes: those on the
left being the Mexican type, those on the upper right the Kusai lime,
the latter much resembling a mandarin orange in shape, and has a
loose skin, but the pulp is very juicy and exceedingly sour. This
lime has become very popular in Hawaii, grows readily from seed, and
produces true. To Mr. Henry Swinton is due the credit of introducing
this variety in 1885 from Kusai, or Strong's Island, Micronesia.</p>

BREADFRUIT (Hawaiian var.)<br />
"ULU."
</h2>

<p>The first breadfruit trees were brought from Tahiti by the
Hawaiians who, landing at Ewa, carried them across the mountain,
and presented them to one of the Chiefs of Oahu, who lived
at Kualoa. There they were planted and thrived. At the present
day this variety of the breadfruit, now called the Hawaiian variety,
is to be found growing wild throughout the Islands. There
are many varieties of this handsome tree, which grows to a
height of from 15 to 40 feet. It thrives best in hot, moist places,
and requires a great deal of water.</p>

<p>Its large ovate leaves are rough and deeply lobed. The male
flower is a large yellow catkin. The fruit is formed from the
female flowers, and is attached to the branches by large stems.
In shape it is either round or oblong, varying in size from 5 to 8
inches in diameter. The thick, tough rind is, in some varieties
muricated, and in others it is reticulated. In color it is green,
changing to brownish when the fruit is ripe. The pulp is firm,
mealy, and somewhat fibrous, and as an article of diet is much
esteemed. Propagation is by suckers, or by layers from the
branches.</p>

BREADFRUIT (Samoan var.)

<p>This variety was introduced to these Islands by Mr. James
Bicknell. Its large, oval leaves are leathery and rough, and less
deeply lobed than are those of the Hawaiian variety. The round
fruit has a characteristic raised ring where it is attached to the
long stem. The yellowish-green rind is reticulated, and the
orange-colored pulp is somewhat sticky when cooked, and is very
sweet. This variety occasionally produces seed.</p>

JACK FRUIT.
</h2>

<p>This tree is a native of India and Malay. And was introduced
to Hawaii by Mr. David Forbes of Kukuihaele, Hawaii. The
Jack fruit is a large, handsome tree, with leaves from 4 to 6
inches in length, which on the old growth are obovate-oblong
and on the young branches are narrow. The oblong, irregular
fruit, which varies in weight from 20 to 60 pounds, is borne on
the trunk, as well as on the old branches. The green rind is
covered with small hexagonal knobs. The pulp when ripe has
all overpowering odor and is seldom eaten; but the oily seeds
when roasted are edible, and are said to resemble chestnuts. On
Tantalus, Oahu, the Jack fruit thrives well, and has produced
fair sized fruits. It is a tree that needs a great deal of moisture,
and consequently is seldom grown on the low lands.</p>

<p>This small, hardy evergreen tree is very common in Hawaii.
Its dark green, glabrous leaves are pointed, elliptical, and are
shiny on the upper surface, but rusty beneath. The greenish-yellow
flowers are usually solitary, and have a peculiar odor. The fruit
is large, varying in weight from 1 to 15 pounds. In shape, it is
either oblong or conical and blunt. The rough, dark green, shiny
skin, which is irregular in thickness, is studded with fleshy
spines. The soft, white, cotton-like pulp is divided into sections,
each containing a shiny, black seed, about half an inch long. These
are very readily propagated.</p>

CHERIMOYER.
</h2>

<p>The Cherimoyer, a well-known fruit of the tropics, is said to
be a native of Peru. It is naturalized in Central America, is
hardy in the mildest coast regions of Spain, and in Jamaica is
cultivated up to an elevation of nearly 5000 feet. It thrives on
the Florida Keys, and is also grown to a limited extent in Southern
California. The tree grows to a height of from 10 to 20 feet;
its branches are spreading, and the dark, shiny leaves are either
ovate or oblong, and are sparsely hairy above and velvety beneath.</p>

<p>The single petaled, velvety-green flowers are very fragrant.
The fruit, which is about the size of a large orange, is heart-shaped
and slightly flattened at the stem end. When ripe, the
skin is a greyish-green, and is covered with slightly-raised semicircular
markings. The white pulp, which is soft and rich, is
divided into cells, each containing a black seed about the size of
an ordinary bean. The Cherimoyer comes true to seed and bears
in about three years. It is one of the most delicious fruits, and
its delicate, slightly-acid flavor is very characteristic. The
Cherimoyer was one of the earliest fruits introduced to these
Islands, and the best specimens of its kind are grown in Kona
and Kau, Hawaii, where it continues to propagate itself naturally
from seed.</p>

CUSTARD APPLE.
</h2>

<p>This tree, which is not common in Hawaii, is rather delicate,
and grows to a height of from 10 to 15 feet. It is a native of the
Antilles, and is a very popular tree in the West Indies. It thrives
in Southern California. Its leaves, which are either lanceolate
or oblong and pointed, are glabrous above and rough beneath.
In color they are light green and rather brittle, when bruised
they emit a very unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>The flowers are three-petaled and are greenish or yellowish,
with purple spots at the base. Artificial pollination will induce
the flowers to set and produce better crops. The heart-shaped
fruit is from 3 to 5 inches in diameter. The skin is
smooth, with small depressions; when ripe, it is a pinkish-yellow
and shading to a russet. Next to the skin the pulp is soft and
creamy-yellow, while toward the center it is quite white. The
flavor is sweet and delicious. There are numerous smooth, black
seeds. This fruit, like its cousin the Cherimoyer grows true to
seed.</p>

MANGO.
</h2>

<p>The mango, which is a native of South Asia, is extensively
cultivated throughout India, the Islands of the West Indies, and
somewhat in Florida. In Hawaii it has become thoroughly naturalized,
and is one of the most common trees; growing from the sea level up
to about 1,000 feet.</p>

<p>A hot, rather dry, climate, with well-drained soil suits it best.
It is an evergreen, shady tree of quick growing habit, sometimes
reaching a height of 70 feet, and having a round, dense top. All
parts of the mango tree have a resinous fragrance, that suggests
turpentine. Its thick, shiny leaves are from 6 to 10 inches in
length. The greenish, scented flowers are borne in large terminal
panicles; and these are
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: folowed">followed</span>
three or four months later by
the fruit, which is large and kidney-shaped, having a smooth,
rather soft, pale-green skin, with tints of yellow and red. The
large seed is nearly as long as the fruit, its shell is rough and
fibrous, and the kernel is shaped like a bean. In the inferior
varieties of mangoes the pulp is full of fibre and tastes strongly
of turpentine. There are numerous varieties of the mango cultivated
in Hawaii; the fruit of which varies much in point of flavor,
juiciness, as well as in the size and shape of the seed.</p>

<p>Within the past ten years improved varieties have been imported;
notably the Alphonse, Cambodiana, Pirie, and many others. These have
thrived well and have borne delicious fruit; from them many grafts
have been made and the finer grades of mangoes have been disseminated.
Propagation is effected by seed, by grafting or inarching, and by
budding. The mango as a rule does not come true to seed; also
seedlings take much longer to fruit than do the grafted trees.</p>

MANINI MANGO.
</h2>

<p>This tree is supposed to be the first mango tree brought to
the Hawaiian Islands. It was planted in the early part of the
nineteenth century by Don Marin, whom the Hawaiians familiarly
called "Manini." He brought to Hawaii many useful trees
and plants; among the number was this mango, which he planted
in his vineyard, then known as "Ka Pa Waina," and there it
may be found today; a venerable tree standing about 80 feet
high, having a spread of over 100 feet, and its trunk measuring
15 feet in circumference. Although a prolific bearer, its fruits,
which are borne in large clusters, are small, and of an inferior
quality, having a thick skin and a large, hairy seed.</p>

<p>This mango, with its distinctive shape, is one of the few types
that comes true to seed. The first and original tree, which was
planted at the Government Nursery, Honolulu, was brought from
Jamaica by Joseph Marsden, Esq. This tree is a prolific bearer,
and its seeds have been widely distributed throughout these

BANANA&mdash;"MAIA."
</h2>

<p>The banana, which has been cultivated from the most remote
times, is a plant of great importance in tropical and sub-tropical
climates, where its highly nutritious fruit is used as food. It is a
large herbaceous, slightly shrubby, plant of very easy growth,
having immense, gracefully-arching, undivided leaves. There
are numerous varieties, the fruit of which differs in shape, color
and flavor.</p>

<p>As decorative plants in landscape gardening, few subjects
equal the choice species of the banana; and on account of its
utility, combined with its beauty, it is considered one of the most
valuable of tropical products. Propagation is by off-shoots or
suckers. When a stalk is cut, the fruit of which has ripened,
sprouts are put forth which in time bear fruit. The enormous
flower stalk issues from the
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: centre">center</span>
of the crown of leaves, and
curves over with its own weight.</p>

<p>The flowers are arranged in a dense terminal panicle; they
alternate with large, reddish scales, which drop off as the fruit
stalk develops, and the finger-like fruits are in clusters. The
Hawaiians seem to have possessed the banana from the earliest
times, and about fifty varieties were known to the older natives.
However, since the year 1855, the so-called Chinese banana
(<i>Musa Cavendishii</i>), which was at that time introduced from
Tahiti, has crowded out the native varieties, many of which are
now extinct.</p>

<p>The accompanying cut shows a few of the different forms and
sizes of the banana grown in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This species is found in nearly all the Pacific Islands. The
date of its introduction to Hawaii, however, is not recorded. It
is a small tree which grows in the low lands. Its shiny, oval
leaves have short petioles. The white flowers are about 1 inch
in length. The fruit is whitish-yellow when mature, and when
decaying it emits a very offensive odor. The seeds are interesting
because they will float a great length of time in salt water,
their buoyancy is caused by a distinct air cell.</p>

"OHELO."

<p>This is an erect dwarf shrub growing to a height of from one
to two feet, having stiff, crowded branches with leaves varying
in form, from oblong to obovate, and in color from green to
green tinged with yellow and red. The white flowers are solitary,
and come mostly in the axils of the true leaves. The globose
fruit is a fleshy, shiny berry, much resembling the cranberry;
in color it is yellow or pale rose, and is covered with a
waxy bloom.</p>

<p>The Ohelo thrives best in the higher elevations, from 4000
to 8000 feet. It grows particularly well on the mountain slopes
of Hawaii and Maui. It is an edible berry, and is the principal
food of the rare Hawaiian goose, now to be found in only a few
localities. The Ohelo has always been a favorite subject of
Hawaiian songs and legends, and was used as one of the offerings
to the Goddess Pele.</p>

TREE&mdash;"KUKUI NUT."
</h2>

<p>The Kukui tree is easily recognizable from afar off by the pale
hue of its foliage, which appears to be dusted over with flour. It
is a handsome, soft wood, evergreen tree, growing to a height of
from 40 to 60 feet, and is widely spread over tropical Polynesia,
and a great part of Malaysia; and by all branches of the Polynesian
race it is called by the same name: Kukui or Tutui. The Hawaiians
tattooed their skins with a black dye which they prepared
from the juice which is found in the fleshy covering of the green
fruit. The leaves are alternate, 3 to 5 lobed, pubescent, and have
long petioles. The yellowish-green flowers are in terminal clusters.
The fruit is spherical, from 1 to 2 inches in diameter, and
light-green in color, changing to a dull-brown when ripe. It
contains one or more nuts, or seeds, which have a very hard,
boney shell, the surface of which is uneven like the shell of a
walnut. The kernels of this nut, when dried, were strung together,
or bound on sticks, and served the natives for torches or
candles: thus the English name of Candlenut Tree. The oil obtained
from the nut was used by the Hawaiians for burning in
stone lamps. The kernel, when baked, pounded, and mixed with
salt and Chili peppers, makes a brown paste which is very appetizing.
This is much esteemed by the Hawaiians, who call it
"Inamona."</p>

CANARY NUT.
</h2>

<p>This medium-sized nut-bearing tree is found growing in Java,
Guam and the Philippines, and from any one of those countries
may have been introduced to Hawaii. A fine specimen may be
seen at the Government Nursery, Honolulu. Its leaves are alternate,
odd pinnate. The small flowers come in terminal
panicles. The fruit or nut is ellipsoidal. The thick skin, which
is purple-colored when ripe, covers a hard, three-lobed stone,
which differs from a pecan nut only in that it is sharp at each
end. The kernel is small, sweet and edible. Trees propagated
from the mature nuts.</p>

BHEL OR BAEL FRUIT.
</h2>

<p>This small spinose tree is a native of tropical Asia, and although
not commonly grown in Hawaii, specimens may be found
in several gardens. It has alternate trifoliolate leaves, and
flowers, which grow in clusters, are small and fragrant. The
gourd-like fruit, with its hard shell, is from 2 to 4 inches in
diameter, and is either round or pear-shaped, and although heavy
and solid, it will float in water. The rind, when ripe, is a yellowish-brown
color, and is studded with oil cells. The interior surface
of the skin is lined with open-mouthed cells, which pour
their gummy secretions into the interior of the carpel, filling it
and bathing the seed. The pulp is sweet and aromatic, and is
esteemed for making conserves, and also as a cooling drink.</p>

<p>In India, the roots and leaves are used medicinally. Bael gum
is a sticky, astringent substance soluble in water. The fruit contains
several large, flat, woolly seeds, which germinate readily,
and the plant is also very easily propagated from root cuttings.</p>

The first tree of this variety was brought to Hawaii by Mr.
Afong, and planted at his residence in Nuuanu avenue, Honolulu,
in the year 1870.</p>

<p>The leaves are alternate, and abruptly pinnate; the oblong
leaflets are not quite opposite. Flowers pale green, small and
regular, producing bunches of reddish-colored fruits, each about
the size of a small walnut. They are covered with a parchment-like
skin having many soft spines. The interior
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: consistss">consists</span>
of a large seed covered with a whitish pulp of a sweetish acid flavor;
this pulp when dried in the shell becomes somewhat shriveled,
brownish in color, and very sweet.</p>

<p>The fruiting season is in July, and as there are but few trees
here that bear, high prices are obtained for this rare fruit, which
is much prized by the Chinese. Fresh seeds will germinate,
but it requires so many years for these seedlings to bear that
grafted and budded plants are imported from China.</p>

order give the head of the tree the form of a
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: parobola">parabola</span>.
The leaves are about 8 inches long and 4 inches broad at the middle;
they are a beautiful green on the upper side and a delicate olive
on the under side. The flowers resemble a single rose with dark-red
petals. The fruit is round, about the size of a small orange,
and has a characteristic persistent calyx. The shell is at first
green, and when ripe changes to purplish-brown marked with
yellow spots. The Mangosteen is called the queen of fruits, and
the tree upon which it is produced is most graceful and beautiful.</p>

<p>Those who have tasted this fruit in its perfection declare it to
be indescribably delicious. The Mangosteen must have a hot,
moist, and fairly equable climate throughout the year.</p>

<p>Many Mangosteen trees have been brought to Hawaii, and
have received intelligent care, but they have not thrived well;
and have eventually died. Only two have ever produced fruit;
one in the garden of Mr. Francis Gay of Kauai, which bears its

formerly the property of Mr. Harry Turton.</p>

CHOCOLATE, COCOA.

<p>In Hawaii this tropical tree grows to a height of from
10 to 30 feet. It has large, pointed leaves, and the new
growth is wine-colored. The flowers appear on the trunk and
mature branches, and the fruit which follows is about 8 to 12
inches long, and is called the pod; inside of this pod are beans or
seeds, from which the commercial product called cocoa is made,
through a process of drying and curing. Chocolate is the term
used for the sweetened preparations of the roasted and ground
beans, with a large proportion of the original fat retained. Cocoa
preparations are the same material in fine powder, sweetened and
unsweetened, with a greater part of the fat extracted.</p>

<p>Cacao cultivation has never been successfully attempted in Hawaii.
However, a few isolated trees can be found at Ahuimanu

<p>The Monstera deliciosa, one of the grandest of arid plants, is
a native of the mountainous regions of Guatamala and Brazil.
It climbs to a height of 12 or more feet, and its leaf stalks are
often 3 feet long. It obtains nourishment from the tree upon
which it attaches itself. Its leaves are huge and perforated. As
the plant climbs, the stems emit aerial roots, many of which never
reach the ground. The fruit which has the appearance of an
elongated pine-cone, grows to a length of from 6 to 12 inches,
and is about 2&frac12; inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The rind is composed of plates which may be detached when
the fruit is quite ripe. It is green in color until it ripens, when
there appears a slight tinge of yellow. The creamy-white pulp
has a most <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: declicious">delicious</span>
flavor, somewhat resembling the banana,
and also like the pineapple. It requires 18 months to mature the
fruit. Propagation is by cuttings.</p>

<p>This spreading tree is a native of the West Indies; and although
it is seen in several gardens of our Islands, it is not common.
The first tree of its kind was planted by Mr. Henry Davis
in his grounds at Punahou. The tree grows to a height of from
15 to 20 feet. The light-green, leathery leaves are oval and
rough, its pink flowers have a peculiar, strong fragrance. The
fruit consists of two distinct parts; the heart-shaped nut or seed
and the fleshy, pear-shaped receptacle to which it is attached. This
receptacle is from 2 to 4 inches long, is either red or yellow, and
is very juicy and astringent. The nut or seed is edible when
roasted. It is much appreciated in the West Indies. While being
roasted the fumes are said to be poisonous.</p>

<i>Olea Europea.</i><br />
OLIVE.
</h2>

<p>The Olive, which is a native of Southwestern Asia, is not a tree
of any great height, but is very longlived, and yields prolifically.
Although not cultivated to any extent, the Olive has been growing
in Hawaii for many years. However, it has fruited only in
a few favorable localities, and nothing has ever been done to
test its value commercially.</p>

<p>The tree thrives best in a warm, dry atmosphere, where the
soil is rich and well drained. Long-continued droughts so detrimental
to most plants will affect the Olive but slightly. The tree
requires judicious pruning immediately after the fruit is gathered,
when the sap is comparatively at rest. The small, thick
leaves are lanceolate, opposite, and usually entire; they are dull
green above and silvery beneath. The small white flowers, which
come in panicles, are usually imperfect. The fruit is a small,
ellipsoid drupe, which is bluish-black when ripe. Its oil is
an important product. The Olive may be propagated from
seeds, cuttings, layers, suckers and pieces of the old stumps. The
seeds require some time to germinate, and the growth of the
young plant is slow.</p>

Hillebrand. A fine tree of this species is growing in Mrs. Foster's
garden, Nuuanu avenue. It has large pinnate leaves, and
panicles of purple flowers. The peculiar rough, grey, oblong
fruits hang from a long stem, and present an odd appearance.
This tree and also one other of the same variety growing in the
grounds of the Queen's Hospital, very rarely set their fruit. Because
of the difficulty of obtaining seeds, the sausage tree has not
been widely distributed.</p>

THE DATE PALM.
</h2>

<p>The date, which is a native of North Africa, Arabia, and Persia,
is a noble palm, often growing to a height of from 80 to 100
feet. It is of remarkable longevity, and will continue to produce
fruit even at the age of a hundred years. The neighborhood of
the sea is
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: considereed">considered</span>
unfavorable to their production, although they will luxuriate in
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: satlish">saltish</span>
soil and bear well when brackish water is used.</p>

<p>Many varieties of dates exist, the fruit differing in shape, size
and color. They will grow from seeds, although the superior
varieties can be continued only from off-shoots of the root. These
will commence to bear in five years. In Asia, the growers of the
commercial date find it necessary to pollinate artificially by hanging
sprays of the male flowers in the branches of the fruit-bearing
trees. There are no imported trees bearing in Hawaii, and
although there are many date trees in Honolulu, artificial pollination
would doubtless greatly increase the yield and the quality of
the fruit.</p>

<p>This interesting palm is seldom seen in Hawaii; there being

Its stem is capitately thickened at the persistent bases of
the armed petioles. The glaucous leaves are pari-pinnate with
narrow, lanceolate, accuminate segments, having a prominent
mid-rib.</p>

<p>The inflorescence is simple and branching. The fruit is arranged
similar to that of Cocos, each about three-fourths of an

it is a bright yellow, and its juicy, edible pulp has the flavor of
apricots.</p>

COCOANUT PALM.<br />
"NIU."
</h2>

<p>The original home of this widely-diffused tree is not positively
known. Some writers say it is indigenous to the islands of the
Indian Ocean; others show that in all probability it is of
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;in original book: Ameriican">American</span>
origin. On account of its buoyant husk and impervious
shell, it was enabled to drift across the oceans without losing its
germinating power, and in this manner was widely dispersed. It
is strictly a tropical plant, and grows naturally on the seashore,
or in its immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>It has pinnate leaves about 12 to 18 feet long, and the inflorescence
first appears in a cylindrical sheath, which splits length-wise,
exposing long sprays of male flowers, and near the base
generally one female flower, which is much larger, and eventually
develops into a fruit. The picture shows both forms of flowers, as
well as a young nut, and also a mature cocoanut. Propagation
is by means of the nut alone, which must be thoroughly ripe
before planting. The outer husk must be left on, germination
taking place at the largest eye; sometimes two eyes may sprout,
and twin trees grow from these. Many varieties have been imported
from islands of the Pacific, Ceylon, West Indies, and Central
America. The cocoanut is not raised in Hawaii for commercial
purposes.</p>

whitish branches are very brittle. The leaves are obovate, oblong,
glabrous above and shiny beneath. The subsessile flowers are
whiteish-purple. The fruit, which is half inch in diameter, is
bluntly pointed and smooth. The fleshy pulp is sticky, and adheres
to the single seed. This plant may be grown from seeds

ALGAROBA&mdash;"KIAWE."
</h2>

<p>The Kiawe deserves a special mention in this book, as it is,
in my opinion, one of the most valuable and beautiful trees that
grows in the Hawaiian Islands. Perhaps on account of its very
general dissemination, and because of the ease with which it
spreads spontaneously, even in the driest districts, it has received
less consideration than has been accorded to other plants
more difficult of propagation.</p>

<p>The Kiawe is the foundation of all the beauty of our lowlands,
and provides a delicate background for other plants. Under
favorable circumstances, it reaches to a height of 50 feet. It
has wide-spreading branches and delicate-green foliage. The
flowers yield a delicious honey, and the seed-pods furnish a valuable
fodder, and, finally, when the tree is cut down, its wood
makes the very best of fuel. The Algaroba is a native of Central
and South America. Ordinarily it is a moderate-sized tree
of quick and easy growth. Its branches in most cases are
covered with stout, cylindrical, axillary spines, and in other cases
they are unarmed.</p>

<p>The abruptly bi-pinnate leaves have from 6 to 30 pairs of linear
leaflets about one-fourth to one inch in length. The small, pale-yellow
flowers come in cylindrical spikes. The straight or sickle-shaped
seed-pod is sweet, and is eaten by stock. Propagation
is by seed.</p>

<p>The first Algaroba tree of Hawaii was brought to Honolulu
in 1828 by Father Bachelot, founder of the Roman Catholic Mission
in the Islands. It was planted in the Mission garden, where
the venerable tree is standing today.</p>

<p>The relative size of items noted in the captions
of the Plates relates to the original book, not to this document.
Scaling of the images in preparation of this ebook and the size and resolution
of the media on which the ebook is read make general statements about
relative size of the pictured items impossible.</p>
<p>The "Index" was completely reworked so that it
reflects the titles and captions within the body of the book. The
original style was maintained. Details of changes to the "Index" are
omitted.
Links in the "Index" point to the text preceding a Plate, not the
Plate itself, whereas the page number indicates the Plate.</p>
<p>When opening the original book to any of the Plate
pages, the associated text appeared on the left hand page and the Plate
appeared on the right hand page. Therefore, in this ebook, the text
associated with a Plate always precedes the Plate.</p>
<p>
The text of the book varies from the original in that obvious misprints
have been fixed. Where the intent of the misprint was not obvious, it has
